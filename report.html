  <header><h2>INTRODUCTION: </h2></header>

    This website portrays as artistic group of individuals with the intentions to express there selves and others by photography, they 
    give a platform to people who want to document important memories, the structure is quite simple,i used the component technique ilearn by developing
    in react, which is reusing component and separate .html .css .js file in separate folder named after their respective pages. 

  <header> <h2>INSPIRATIONS: </h2></header>
    Three websites inspired me to adopt this kind of design which are modern goldsmiths website, uol portal, apple.com.
    what do they have in common?, the answer is simple dynamic and informative desin that keeps the user enganged with the website and 
    it tells the story of what the website is for, how it is used and what features to check out,

  <header> <h2>ACCESSIBILITY: </h2></header>
  <ul>
    <li>
       Rision: <br> when I thought accessibilty, the first thing came to mind was vision and how is it easy and appealing on the eyes 
        so I chose to work with black and white colors, as they are easy to use and proven that white text on black background are actually more
        comfortable than black text on white backgrounds. 
        
    </li>
    <li>
       Information and story telling: <br> Information and story telling are crucial to a website's flow as the main purpose of the website 
        is to give information about something or a topic or someone, in this website my technique is making the flow of the website clear and visible to the user
        so if the user is interested on whats going one the bread crumbs will reveal the story behind what we (the website's company) do.
        
    </li>
    <li>
        Responsive design <br> A responsive design is a necessity as most of the users nowadays access the internet with handheld devices like mobile phone or tablets,
        so my feature was manipulating css to reorganize some elements of the website to fit any screen size while keeping the flow of the website going, and for the navigation 
        bar I managed to change the whole layout of it to  make it in the reach of a press of a finger to activate the slide animation revealing the navigation bar with all the links 
        at reach. 

    </li>
  </ul>
  <header> <h2>USABILITY </h2></header>
  <ul>
    <li>
       Separation: <br> While using the site I thought how would a user know when a section ends or starts, as most of the websites online I used banners to 
        state what section is below and to inform the user of the kind of information coming.
        
    </li>
    <li>
       Hover states: <br> Hover states are consider a designing treat but it can be used to indicate where the selection or the curser is, I consider it as a book mark
        to were the user is ready/looking.
        
    </li>
    <li>
       Gallery: <br> In the gallet page there are three buttons where the user can control the viewing style of the images, if we consider using a huge galley,
        a one column view might be inefficient as it will take more space and data to load and some of the information might be far fetched, so a one column, towering
        column, four column views will give the user the control to either widen the image or inspect the images as a grid.
        
    </li>
  </ul>
  <header> <h2>SELF TAUGHT SKILLS </h2></header>
  <ul>
    <li>
       javascript event listeners: <br> when working with drop-downs and the navigation bar, I learned the concept of event listener, where without adding an onclick
        attribut, from the .js file of the page we can add event listeners like click, mouseOver, mouseOut and many more, this concept is pretty interest because
        it is more controlable and  efficient while working with huge websites and atributes get tangled up.
        
    </li>
    <li>
       js DOM: <br> As stating before, while add an event listener, we have to wait for and event to happen so it may trigger another, triggering another event
        requires us to manipulate HTML styling without css, here where the js DOM comes, DOM or as known as Document Object Model is resposible for styling css according 
        specific triggers like the slide of the mobile-view navigation bar or the drop down on click photos.
        
    </li>
    <li>
       CSS ::before & ::after properties: While working with css and images, i found it messy to add divs or elements before or after the picture and size them with css
        especially if these div have only paragraphs in them, so i found way around it by usiing the :before and :after that create an element that can be style and positioned
        freely if used with an absolute property. <br> 
        
    </li>
  </ul>
  <header> <h2>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? </h2></header>
   
    I think the animations and the design just went well all together because as I researched online, working with a two colored design is pretty challenging but while
    working with this website, I think it all went good together, because the layout and the design are more important that the content for the reason that if the layout
    isn't well organized or the design is rough, then the user will question the credibility of the website,
